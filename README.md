# KogaChat Custom Chatbox

KogaChat is a fancy name for just a few files used on Streamlabs for the chatbox found on my Twitch stream. Putting it here as easier access for folks who would like to use it.

## How to use

If you're only interested in using the latest version, check the [snippets markdown](https://github.com/dististik/chatbox.kogachat/blob/master/SNIPPETS.md) for the single time copy and pastes you'll need. This will keep your chatbox always using the most up-to-date version of KogaChat at all times.

If you'd like to use a specific version of KogaChat, you can grab the files from the [releases page](https://github.com/dististik/chatbox.kogachat/releases) and copy and paste the contents of index.html, style.css, and script.js into the HTML, CSS, and JS tabs of Streamlabs' custom code tabs with "Enable Custom HTML/CSS" set to Enabled.

## Contributing

Feel free to suggest changes or report bugs with issues or pull requests. No real guidelines here other than please don't make duplicates and make sure your pull requests actually work since this is literally just three files.
