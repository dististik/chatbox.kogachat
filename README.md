# KogaChat Custom Chatbox

KogaChat is a fancy name for just a few files used on Streamlabs for the chatbox found on my Twitch stream. Putting it here as easier access for folks who would like to use it.

## How to use

Just copy and paste the contents of src/index.html, src/style.css, and src/script.js into the HTML, CSS, and JS tabs respectively in Streamlabs' chatbox with "Enable Custom HTML/CSS" set to Enabled.

## Contributing

Feel free to suggest changes or report bugs with issues or pull requests. No real guidelines here other than please don't make duplicates and make sure your pull requests actually work since this is literally just three files.
